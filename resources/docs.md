## Random tools to manipulate Factorio blueprint strings

While there are already some of those functions built as mods to the
game, one can not use mods while playing for the achievements

### Instructions

Pick a tool on the left hand side in the menu:

- *Tile* : Arrange copies of the blueprint in a grid.  E.g. take a six
  electric miner blueprint and tile 15x15 to cover even the biggest
  resource fields
- *Split* : Split a large blueprint into tiles to make it easier to
  place in game
- *Mirror* : Mirror the blueprint either vertically or horizontally
- *Upgrade* : Decide what common upgradeable entities (e.g. inserters)
  to upgrade.  Also supports downgrading (e.g. you have a great
  blueprint but not the tech yet)
- *Landfill* : Put landfill under a blueprint

Then paste the blueprint string either from the game or from a different
place into the input field, adjust the settings, and finally copy the
final blueprint and import it into Factorio

# [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) Blueprint Tools

Tools to manipulate Factorio blueprints (strings copied from the game) when
playing without mods or providing functions not currently in mods.

Online version: https://christoph-frick.github.io/factorio-blueprint-tools/

Currently supported:

1. **Tile** : Tile the blueprint multiple times on X and Y axis.  Useful to create a large grid of miners.
2. **Mirror** : Mirrors the blueprint on the X or Y axis
3. **Upgrade** : Upgrade (or downgrade) components of a blueprint (e.g. belts, assemblers, ...)
4. **Landfill** : Put landfill tiles under a blueprint to allow placing it on water (in two steps due to the way Factorio handles landfill right now)
